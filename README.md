Single Page TODO list

This application can be accessed by different users only see the tasks they have inputted.

This application uses actual authentication/authorisation to access a user's todolist.

A task is composed by a description and a priority.

Multiple tasks can have the same priority but each task is unique based on the user.

The UI allows the user to do the following operation on a task from within the task list page:

- create
- update
- delete

The UI allows the user to sort the list of tasks by priority.

First, you will have to run `npm install` via your terminal

To start the server, run `nodemon server.js`

Second, you will need to copy & paste the following into your browser of choice `http://localhost:4000/` (preferably Google Chrome)

Third, you will need to sign up and create an account.

Then you can start your todolist!

This application uses a boilerplate created by Jacques Le Normand.
